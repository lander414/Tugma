        <h2>HOW TUGMA WORKS</h2>
        <p>Tugma operates on the principle of simplicity and efficiency. Artists can make an account where they post their ideas, abilities, personality, and of course, their collection of work. Users and publishers can sort through this varied pool of artists, with different experience, skills, styles, and genres, to help you find the exact person you are looking for. Tugma is designed to be a platform that is intuitive, offering artists and publishers the means to find each other by giving them access to features such as; the ability to post, comment, and rate. We believe these three features are the catalyst to collaboration and connection. Tugma ensures that the focus remains on what matters most â€“ the music.</p>
